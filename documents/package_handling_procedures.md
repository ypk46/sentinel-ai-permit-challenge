# Caribe Swift Courier: Internal Procedures Manual

This document outlines the standard operating procedures for Caribe Swift Courier employees. Adhering to these guidelines ensures efficient service, maintains customer satisfaction, and upholds the company's reputation for reliability.

## 1. Package Handling and Delivery Procedures

All employees involved in package handling and delivery must follow these steps:

### 1.1 Receiving Packages (Local Office)

- Upon arrival at the local office from the Miami facility or other branches, verify the manifest against the physical packages.
- Scan each package using the designated handheld scanner to update its status in the system to "Arrived at Local Office."
- Sort packages based on delivery route or customer pickup.
- Immediately report any discrepancies (missing or damaged packages) to the shift supervisor.
- Store packages securely in the designated sorting or storage area.

### 1.2 Preparing for Delivery

- Drivers must check their assigned delivery manifest against the packages loaded into their vehicle.
- Scan packages again when loading onto the delivery vehicle to update status to "Out for Delivery."
- Ensure packages are loaded securely to prevent damage during transit.
- Plan the delivery route efficiently using company-provided tools or guidelines.

### 1.3 Delivery Attempts

- Upon reaching the delivery address, verify the address details on the package.
- Attempt to deliver the package to the recipient or an authorized person at the address.
- Request a signature and printed name from the person receiving the package.
- Scan the package as "Delivered" using the handheld scanner, capturing the recipient's signature if the device allows.
- If the recipient is unavailable, attempt to leave the package with a neighbor (if permissible and secure) or leave a delivery attempt notification slip with instructions for redelivery or pickup.
- Scan the package as "Attempted Delivery" if delivery is unsuccessful, noting the reason (e.g., "Recipient Unavailable," "Incorrect Address").

### 1.4 Handling Failed Deliveries

- Return undelivered packages to the local office at the end of the delivery route.
- Hand over undelivered packages and the delivery manifest to the designated office staff.
- Provide a brief report to the supervisor regarding any significant delivery challenges encountered.
- Office staff will scan returned packages to update their status to "Returned to Office" and follow up according to company policy (e.g., contacting the customer).
