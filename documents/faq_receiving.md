# Caribe Swift Courier: Your Questions Answered

## Receiving Packages

**How do I set my address on popular shopping sites like Amazon, Shein, Temu, etc., to receive packages through Caribe Swift Courier?**

To ensure your packages are delivered to our facility for you to pick up or for onward delivery, you'll need to use our designated Miami address as your shipping address on these sites.

Here’s a general format for setting your address:

Your Name
Caribe Swift Courier - [Your Account Number]
8105 NW 33rd St
Miami, FL 33122
United States

**Important:** Replace `[Your Account Number]` with the unique account number assigned to you when you open an account with us. This number is crucial for us to identify your packages upon arrival at our Miami facility.

Always double-check that you have entered the address and your account number correctly to avoid delays or issues with your deliveries.

**How will I know when my package arrives?**

Once your package arrives at our facility in the Dominican Republic and is processed, we will notify you through your preferred method of contact (email, SMS, or through your account dashboard). You can also track your package using our online tracking system.

**How can I check the status of my package?**

You have several ways to track your package:

- **Online Tracking System:** Visit our website and enter your tracking number in the tracking section. You will see real-time updates on the status and location of your package.
- **Account Dashboard:** If you have an account with us, log in to your dashboard to view the status of all your incoming and outgoing packages.
- **Customer Service:** You can contact our customer service team via phone or email, providing your tracking number, and they will assist you in tracking your package.

**What do I need to bring to pick up my package?**

To pick up your package, you will need to present a valid government-issued ID (Cédula, Pasaporte, or Licencia de Conducir). If someone else is picking up the package on your behalf, they will need a written authorization from you, a copy of your ID, and their own valid ID.
